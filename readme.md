# New Face No Trace

The goal of this project was to find an API and use it in a creative way. I decided on the RandomUser.me API, which provides random user data and includes fields such as Picture, Name, Address, etc.

The purpose of the site is to generate a fake passport for wanted fugitives attempting to flee the country.
