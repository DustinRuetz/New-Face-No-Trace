# New Face No Trace

The goal of this project was to find an API and use it in a creative way. I decided on the RandomUser.me API, which provides user data and features fields such as Picture, Name, Address, etc. The purpose of the site is to generate a fake passport for wanted fugitives attempting to flee the country.

Version 1 is live! Go to <a href="http://newfacenotrace.com">NewFaceNoTrace.com</a> to see it in action.
